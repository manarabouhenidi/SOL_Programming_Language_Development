# SOL_Programming_Language_Development
Awarded as a Second Place Winner For Fall 2018 at the Computer Science Symposium at St.Mary's University in San Antonio Texas for developing a programming language at the Survey of Programming language course instructed and guided by Dr. Arthur Hanna. I have used the metalanguage BNF  to specify SOL syntax. This project is not intended to be sold or used.
